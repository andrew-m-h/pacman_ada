# AdaCurses

AdaCurses is a great ncurses5 binding to Ada-95 written by Thomas E. Dickey and available at https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-Ada95.html.

Here is the PKGBUILD which worked for me (I had to change the pkgbuild because the FTP links changed) Also in this directory is the source which I know works, in case something changes and we need a stable version.
